</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Three</span> or four
more days of
strain, and then
the abscess in the ear
broke, causing speedy relief.
The first thing that
Roy did was to fall into a profound
sleep, which lasted some hours.</p>

<p>When he woke up, feeling markedly
better, his murmur was for "Den!" as
usual; and since no reply came, he
said "Den!" more loudly.</p>

<p>Then he took a good look round. The
light from the window was getting dim,
and the pain in his ear was gone. He
saw Denham near, leaning back in the
only pretence at an easy-chair which the
room could boast of. Ivor's head was
resting against the wall, and he seemed
to be in a heavy slumber. Boys of
twelve or thirteen are not always thoughtful
about other people; but an odd feeling
came over Roy, as he noted the fine-looking
young soldier in that attitude of
utter weariness. All these days and
nights of his illness he had actually
never once seen Ivor asleep until now.</p>

<p>"He must be tired, I'm sure," Roy
said aloud. "But I think I'm hungry.
I wish he would wake up."</p>

<p>The room door opened very slowly and
softly, and Roy's eyes grew round with
astonishment. Nobody entered this
infected place except the doctor and the
old Frenchwoman in the mornings, and
the latter always got away as fast as she
could. This new-comer seemed to be in
no hurry. She stepped inside, closed
the door, and advanced towards the bed.
There she stood still to look at Roy; and
then she turned to gaze pityingly at
Ivor.</p>

<p>Roy stared hard, fascinated. She was
quite a girl, perhaps two or three years
older than Polly. She was very slight,
with a plain neatly-fitting dress. The
lighted candle in her hand threw a strong
glow upon her face. It was a particularly
sweet face, delicate and gentle; and
it would have been exceedingly pretty,
but for the very evident ravages of a
long-past attack of small-pox. There
were no "pits" on her skin, but a
certain soft roughness characterised the
whole, as if, once upon a time, it had
been covered with pits. Now it was
pale, and the features were even, while
short black hair curled over a wide forehead,
and the dark eyes were full of an
intense sadness. Even Roy could not
but see that great sadness. As he
looked at her she looked at him, and
then she sighed.</p>

<p>"Pauvre petit!" she said softly.</p>

<p>She came close to the bed, and Roy
put out his hand, only to snatch it
back.</p>

<p>"Oh, I mustn't; I forgot. Den told
me I must not touch anybody except
him, not even that ugly old woman who
comes in, because I'm all small-poxy,
you know. And oh! I'm so thirsty. I
wish he would wake up."</p>

<p>"Pauvre enfant!" She went to the
table, and brought back a glass of
milk, which she held to his lips. Roy
drank eagerly. Then she smoothed
his bed-clothes, and put his pillow
straight.</p>

<p>"But you oughtn't to be here, you
know; you might catch it," Roy's weak
voice said. "Den would tell you to go.
Can you talk English? I only know a
wee bit of French."</p>

<p>"Yes; I can talk English." She
said the words in foreign style, with a
slow distinctness and separation of the
syllables, but with a pure intonation.
"I learnt English in your country. Yes,
I have been there, for three, four years.
Monsieur votre frère&mdash;your brother&mdash;il a
l'air d'être très fatigué."</p>

<p>"Den isn't my brother. He's only&mdash;he's
just Den, you know. Captain
Denham Ivor, of His Majesty's Guards.
He hasn't been to sleep for ever so
long, and that's why he's tired. My
ear has been so awfully bad, oh! for
days and days. And I couldn't get
to sleep, and Den was always by me&mdash;always."</p>

<p>The girl left Roy, and went closer to
the sleeping man. He remained motionless;
his arms loosely folded; a slight
dew of exhaustion upon the brow; the
face extremely pale. She sheltered the
light from his eyes with her hand, and
looked steadily. Then, turning away,
she began putting things straight in the
room. A few womanly touches altered
wondrously the aspect of the whole.
Roy lay and watched her.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he asked.
"Are you M. de Bertrand's daughter?
I'm deaf in one ear still, so please don't
whisper."</p>

<p>"No; I am Lucille de St. Roques.
M. and Mme. de Bertrand are my good
friends." She flushed slightly. "They
are my best friends in all Paris."</p>

<p>"And do you live here?"</p>

<p>"No; I am come unexpected&mdash;quite
sudden. My friends did not look for me.
When they tell me of the English boy
upstairs, and of the kind Monsieur who
nurses him, then I say I will go and
help. I have had the complaint, and I
do not fear."</p>

<p>"I wonder where your home is?"
Roy said, interested.</p>

<p>"Ah, for that, I have not now a true
home. My home was in the south of
France, but it is my home no longer.
Cependant, I have kind friends at Verdun,
where I live." She laid a hand
on Roy kindly, murmuring, "Pauvre
petit!"</p>

<p>"You don't call me 'little,'" protested
the insulted Roy. "I'm nearly thirteen;
almost a man. And I am going to fight
Napoleon soon. Do you like Napoleon?"
She shook her head. "That's right.
Then you're Royalist; and I am glad, for
I like you, and I don't like Napoleon.
I shall soon be an officer in King
George's Army. I'm going to have a
commission as soon as I'm sixteen.
And then I shall be a brave soldier, you
know, like Denham. And have you a
father and mother at that place, Ver&mdash;something?"</p>

<p>"Verdun." Little dreamt Roy how
familiar a name it would soon become
in his ears. "My father and mother,
they were of the old noblesse, and
they lost their lives in the Revolution,
hélas! Thirteen years ago they were
guillotined."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, how horrid!" exclaimed
Roy, at a loss to express the sympathy
which he really felt. "How dreadful!
Why, you must have been quite a child
then."</p>

<p>"I was not yet eight years old. But
that was in truth a terrible time. I was
in prison with them for many, many
weeks, before they went out to die."</p>

<p>Ivor woke suddenly, opening his eyes
without warning. Then he stood up,
leaning against the solid four-poster for
support, since the room went round with
him dizzily. He saw a girlish figure,
and he vaguely felt that she had no
business there, but a momentary pause
before speech was necessary.</p>

<p>"Do not make so great haste. Will
you not rest a little longer?" a kind
voice said, and a soft hand came on his
wrist.</p>

<p>"But indeed, mademoiselle, you must
go away at once," he urged earnestly.
"It is small-pox. It is&mdash;&mdash;" And he
tried in vain to recall the French word,
though ready enough usually in talking
French. "Pray go. You will take the
infection."</p>

<p>"But me, I do not intend to go," she
replied cheerfully, with her pretty foreign
accent. "You need not be afraid for
me, monsieur. See, I have had it. I
am not in danger, not at all. You are
fatigué, n'est-ce pas? It has been a
long nursing&mdash;yes, so I have heard.
When did you take food last?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p>Denham confessed that he had not
eaten for some time; he had not been
hungry. Well, perhaps he was a trifle
<i>fatigué</i>, but 'twas nothing, nothing at
all. He was ready now for anything.
If Mademoiselle would only not put herself
in danger! By way of showing his
readiness, he made a movement forward,
but he was compelled to sit down, resting
his forehead on his hand. The long
strain had told upon even his vigorous
constitution.</p>

<p>"Ah! C'est ça!" she murmured.
"But you will be better, monsieur, for a
cup of coffee."</p>

<p>Ivor had no choice but to yield, and
she moved daintily about, making such
coffee as only a Frenchwoman can, and
bringing it presently to his side.</p>

<p>"This is not right," he protested.
"I cannot allow you to wait upon me,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>She would listen to no remonstrances,
however, and when he had disposed of
it, she insisted that he should lie down
on a couch in the small adjoining room,
while she undertook to look after Roy.
She had her friends' permission, she
said, not explaining that she had refused
to be forbidden, and Monsieur in his
present state could do no more. How
long was it since he had slept? Ah,
doubtless some days!</p>

<p>Ivor gave in, after much resistance,
and in ten minutes he was again
heavily asleep, not to wake for many
hours. Nature at last was claiming her
revenge.</p>

<p>When he woke, after five hours' unbroken
rest, he was another man. Roy
seemed much better. The doctor had
paid a visit and was gone; the room
could scarcely be recognised as the
same; and Ivor warmly expressed his
gratitude, wondering as he did so at
Lucille's look of steady sadness. She
insisted on coming again the next day,
while he should rest and have an hour's
walk.</p>

<p>"Isn't she nice and jolly?" Roy demanded,
when the door closed behind
Lucille. "I like her, don't you? She
has told me lots of things while you
were asleep. Only think, her father and
mother were both guillotined. <i>Both</i> of
them had their heads cut off. And they
hadn't done one single thing to make
them deserve it. They were awfully
good and kind to everybody, she says.
And she was only a little girl then, and
when they were dead, somebody took
her away to England, and she was there
three or four years. And then she came
back to France, and she lives with some
people at a place called Verdun. She
says they give her a home, and she works
for them. And she would like to go to
England again some day."</p>

<p>But Lucille de St. Roques had not told
Roy the most recent sorrow which had
come to her. She let it out to Captain
Ivor a day or two later. Only one year
before this date she had become engaged
to young Théodore de Bertrand, son of
the old couple downstairs; and three
months later he had been drawn for the
conscription. No use to plead that he
was practically an only son, since the
second son Jacques was a ne'er-do-well,
who had taken himself off, nobody knew
whither. More soldiers were wanted by
the First Consul for his schemes of
foreign conquest, and young De Bertrand
had to go. Scarcely four months after
his departure, news came that he had
been shot in a <i>sortie</i> in the Low
Countries. Large tears filled Lucille's
eyes, and dropped slowly.</p>

<p>"Ah, so many more!" she said.
"Thousands, thousands, called upon to
be slain, for nothing! Not for their
country, but for the ambition of one bad
man. It makes no difference, Monsieur,
that they love not the usurper. My
Théodore was of the Royalist party, yet
he had to go. And the poor old father
and mother&mdash;they are left without one
son in their old age!"</p>

<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p class='ph3'>THE TEETH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> "The Pearls of the Mouth," according
to an Eastern expression, are a great adjunct
to the beauty of the face nobody will dispute.
But that the irregular, saw-edged series of
half-decayed stumps that not uncommonly
take their place are disfiguring, every woman
who possesses them knows to her cost.</p>

<p>Naturally the teeth form an almost even
edge. There is no appreciable space between
them. They are of a pure ivory white
colour, and they are thirty-two in number.
Very few of us, unfortunately, have our teeth
in the natural condition. Too often, alas, do
we lose one or two before growth is completed,
and how few of us keep a respectable
complement of teeth to the end of our three-score
years and ten?</p>

<p>The reason why our teeth are so bad is
partly due to our own faults and partly due to
our civilisation.</p>

<p>You never saw a savage whose teeth were
either decayed or missing. Yet, as far as I
know, no uncivilised person ever used a
toothbrush. But, with ourselves, unless we
use a toothbrush our teeth rapidly decay.
What is the cause of this? It must be something
in our civilisation. This we cannot
alter. But we can preserve our teeth in face
of their tendency to decay by a little care.</p>

<p>There is not one person in ten who knows
how to keep her teeth really clean. You get
up in the morning, and when you have
dressed yourself you scrub your teeth with a
hard brush, using some indifferent powder.
This you consider is sufficient attention to the
teeth for the day. Suppose that your work
consisted of handling greasy bones all day,
do you think your hands would remain clean
if you only washed them once a day? The
teeth have very dirty work to do, and they will
not remain clean if only washed once a day.
As a matter of fact your teeth will only remain
clean till you have had breakfast&mdash;about
ten minutes during the twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>This system of looking after the teeth is
radically wrong. The teeth must be washed
more than once a day. It is better to clean
your teeth after every meal. This is often
inconvenient, but they should certainly be
cleaned at least twice a day, and always before
going to bed. If the teeth are cleaned before
going to sleep, they will remain clean throughout
the night.</p>

<p>How any person can use a stiff toothbrush is
beyond my comprehension. "Oh, but I cannot
get my teeth clean if I use a soft brush!"
Of course you cannot get your teeth clean if
you only wash them once a day. Use the
softest badger brush you can get, and gently
wash your teeth twice or thrice a day instead
of tearing your gums once a day with a hard
brush. You must never make your teeth
bleed. If you tear your gums every morning,
can you wonder that your teeth get loose and
decay? Whenever blood comes from the
gum surrounding a tooth, it comes from a
tear. That tear must be repaired by inflammation
of the gum, and all inflammation
around a tooth tends to loosen the tooth and
causes it to die.</p>

<p>Any good tooth-powder may be used. A
powder containing an antiseptic is better than
any other. Carbolic acid toothpowder is the
best of all. The powder should also contain
some grit to give it a good "grip." Precipitated
chalk alone is not a good powder, but it
is an excellent basis for an antiseptic.</p>

<p>Sometimes the teeth get coated with
"tartar." As the deposit gets thicker it
tends to lever the tooth out of its socket. It
has also an unsightly appearance and often
gives the breath a bad smell, from particles
of food getting beneath it and decomposing.
If there is a considerable amount of tartar
on your teeth, have the teeth scaled; it is
not an expensive business, and well repays
the fee and few minutes discomfort that it
costs.</p>

<p>If it were only for their nasty appearance,
decayed teeth should be treated at once. But
besides being unsightly, they are a real
danger to health. Have them stopped or
extracted.</p>

<p>When a tooth falls out or is extracted, it
leaves a gap. This gap gets smaller in time
because the other teeth fall together to fill up
the space. This causes a most disfiguring
condition by leaving a small space between
each tooth. When you have had a tooth extracted,
have it replaced immediately by a false
one, so that your teeth may form an even line
without any gap between them.</p>

<p>Sugar, very hot and very cold drinks, tea
and sweets, are great enemies to the teeth.
How many girls have lost their teeth from
eating chocolates!</p>

<p>Some drugs have a deleterious influence
upon the teeth. Iron causes them to become
a dirty transparent brown. It is only temporary,
however, and if the teeth are well
cared for during a course of iron, no permanent
damage will ensue.</p>

<p>Calomel is supposed by nearly everybody
to be a great enemy to the teeth, but given as
it is now, in small doses, it in no way affects
them.</p>

<h2><a name="SILVER_POINT" id="SILVER_POINT">SILVER POINT
DRAWING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> light and airy, dainty and
delicate, is this delightful process,
that it may well be called the fairy
queen of the graphic arts. So
white is the paper or card on which
it is produced, and so beautiful
the chemical changes of colour it
undergoes when first produced,
that no process of reproduction
can give more than a faint idea of
the beauty of an original silver
point drawing.</p>

<p>Many times have I been told,
"Oh, I have a silver point drawing
by So-and-so," but on nearly
every occasion, when inspected,
the treasure has turned out to be
merely a photographic reproduction,
giving, it is true, the form of
the original, but without a particle
of its colour or daintiness of
appearance.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it
will be well to commence by stating
what a silver point drawing is,
and how to tell an original from a
reproduction.</p>

<p>A silver point is a drawing made
with a stylus of pure silver on
paper or card specially prepared for
the purpose with a coating of chalk
or china clay applied under heavy
pressure. To tell a real silver point,
hold the drawing to the light edgeways.
You will then see in bright
silver every stroke made by the
stylus. Also you will find, when
looking at the drawing in the
ordinary manner, that its colour
varies in different places; looking
at one part a faint brown, another
blue, another grey; in fact, assuming,
where it has been much worked on,
the appearance of the surface of a
bright silver article which has been
for some time exposed to atmospheric
influence.</p>

(<i>By Ernest M. Jessop.</i>)</div></div>

<p>Before the advent of lead pencils
silver point was greatly in vogue with
the old masters, and fine examples
by some of the greatest of these
are to be found in the national
collections of England and France.
Notable among them are drawings
by Raphael, Perugino, Botticelli,
Holbein and Albert Durer. The
art, which had fallen into disuse,
has of late been revived by many
eminent artists. The late Sir Frederick
Leighton was an ardent devotee
of silver point, and has left many beautiful
specimens of his own drawing.</p>

<p>Both the Prince and Princess of
Wales are great admirers of the art
and possess several specimens drawn
by my friend Mrs. C. Sainton, R.I.,
and myself. The Princess, in the
scant leisure allowed her by the cares
of state, I have reason to believe,
practises the art of silver point, as
well as that of burnt wood work,
a description of which will be given
in these pages very shortly.</p>

<p>And now let me give a few hints
on how to practise almost the most
difficult of all the graphic arts. To
begin with the tools. These are
very simple. From a jeweller you
may procure three pieces of round
silver wire a few inches long. They
should vary in thickness from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
of the thinnest lead in an ordinary pencil to
that found in a six B, and may be used similar
to the leads in an ordinary pencil case or
mounted in wooden handles of the thickness
of a lead pencil. You can buy (although only
of the largest artists' colourmen) both silver
point paper and card; the latter is the best
from its non-liability to cockle.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="450" height="562" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class='center'>STUDY FROM LIFE IN SILVER POINT.</p>

<p class='center'>(<i>By Ernest M. Jessop.</i>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The silver wires may be sharpened to any
point desired on a piece of very fine emery
cloth. Two sizes of round and one flat point
are those usually used.</p>

<p>As to the card or paper. This, it must be
at once understood, is one of the most delicate
of substances. Its surface once soiled, it is
absolutely useless. No mark of any nature
can be erased from it. There is no rubbing
out or slurring over to be practised. If you
scratch its surface with an erasing knife it
alters the colour and the stylus will no longer
mark on the scratched surface. The same
result occurs from the contact of a hot or
greasy hand or the spilling of a spot of water
no matter how quickly removed.</p>

<p>For these reasons no silver point can be
entirely drawn direct from nature. A fairly
finished sketch must first be made; from this
it is advisable to take a careful tracing.
Through this tracing bore very small holes
with a broken etching-needle or small piercer
at all the salient points and at short intervals
along the outline of your subject. Then lay
your tracing on the silver point paper in the
position you intend it to occupy, secure it by
weights, and with your smallest silver point
make a tiny dot through each hole on to the
paper. This is the only guide you can make
to help you. Now lightly indicate your
drawing with fine strokes made diagonally
from right to left downwards, always remembering
that the silver point cannot be rubbed
backwards and forwards the same as a pencil
without destroying the surface of the paper.
All shadows should be put in very lightly at
first, as lights cannot afterwards be added,
although they may be taken away where not
required. To get your deeper shades you
may go over the same places many times with
the silver point if you continue to work downwards.
Either parallel or diagonally crossed
lines may be used to shade. It is as well to
avoid all firm hard outlines, as silver point
mainly depends for its beauty on its misty and
shadowy effects.</p>

<p>As in all classes of art work portraits, after
having been fixed from a sketch, should be
finished direct from nature. Without using
this method you may preserve the features of
your model, but soul and character will
always be wanting. For land and seascape
silver point is peculiarly adapted, as some of
the most delicately beautiful aerial effects may
be attained by its use. For foliage also, used
with a careful knowledge, it is incomparable.
To look its best no silver point drawing
should occupy more than one-fourth of the
paper on which it is drawn, and any attempt
to finish square up to a mount or frame must
be studiously avoided. In fact, the edges of
the drawing should imperceptibly melt away
into the paper. In very fine work, such as
the face of a baby or young girl, a singularly
beautiful effect may be produced by finishing
the features through the aid of a magnifying
glass, thereby removing all traces of lines, and
then in the ordinary manner and with bolder
lines adding hair, figure, costume, etc.</p>

<p>One last word on the choice of paper. This
is made with two kinds of surface, dull and
slightly glazed, like the backs of playing
cards. The latter I have found to give the
best effect in colour. All drawings after they
are completed should be exposed to the atmosphere
(but not to dust) for at least a week,
it taking some time for them to acquire their
beautiful colouring. After the period above
mentioned the colour is absolutely permanent.</p>

<p>In framing the edges of the paper should be
hermetically sealed to the glass so as to
exclude dust.</p>

<p>Frames are always a matter of taste.
Personally I have used with the happiest
effect a wide flat frame of white enamelled
wood with a very narrow pale gold Louis
Seize edging to enrich the opening of it. A
fine silver point in a well-made frame of this
kind is indeed one of those things of beauty
which are joys for ever.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p class='right'>
The Temple.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Dorothy</span>,&mdash;Accept my heartiest
congratulations on your engagement to Gerald
Anstruther. He is a good fellow, and I feel
sure that you will be very happy together.
Your engagement is not one that has been
hurriedly rushed into. You have known each
other for some time and have had an opportunity
of discovering each other's merits and
demerits, if any of the latter exist.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that the wedding is to be
an event of the immediate future, and I have
no doubt that Gerald is quite of my way of
thinking.</p>

<p>I am patriotic enough to be pleased that
you are going to marry an Englishman. Not
that I have any particular prejudice against
foreigners; but their marriage laws differ from
ours and thereby lead to complications.</p>

<p>For instance, a Frenchman, no matter what
his age, cannot legally marry without the
consent of his parents, a fact which it is just
as well for English girls to remember.</p>

<p>Now I know that you will not be offended with
me when I tell you that your <i>fiancé</i>, although
a man of business, is not a business man.</p>

<p>This may sound contradictory, but is not
really so. There are many men who follow
regular occupations and attend to their own
particular business and yet are not, strictly
speaking, men of business habits and instincts.
Literary men, musicians, artists, and inventors
may be generally regarded as instances in
point. And Gerald, who is an engineer and
inventor, is not one of the exceptions to the
rule, which is my reason for offering you the
following suggestions.</p>

<p>In the first place I would strongly advise
you to persuade Gerald to insure his life in
some respectable English office; the American
ones are risky.</p>

<p>It is true that he is making a good income,
but he has very little money put by for a rainy
day, for both of which reasons I would suggest
that he takes out a policy for £1,000 with
profits. The premium for insuring without
profits would be a little less, but I am certain
that it is better on the whole to insure with
profits.</p>

<p>The policy he can assign to you or leave
you in his will, or, if he waits till you are
married, he can, if he likes, effect what is
called a trust policy for your benefit, and, so
long as any object of the trust remains
unperformed, the policy will not form part
of his estate or become subject to his debts.
The last few words of the foregoing sentence
you will be able to understand. You need
not trouble your head about the meaning of
"trust" and "performance"; it is sufficient
for you to know that the arrangement is
intended to benefit married ladies, and can be
carried out under the provisions of the Married
Women's Property Act.</p>

<p>All the above I am aware sounds dreadfully
technical; but it is extremely difficult when
writing on legal matters to avoid legal phraseology,
the danger being that the omission of a
single word in a sentence may have the effect
of giving a totally wrong interpretation of the
law.</p>

<p>The Act which I have mentioned above
also gives you the right to retain sole control
of the money left you by your god-mother.
It was not a very large amount&mdash;£50, if I
remember rightly. I should advise you to
deposit it in the Post Office Savings Bank if
you have not already done so. You will
receive two and a half per cent. annual interest
for it, which is rather more than double what
any ordinary bank would offer you.</p>

<p>There is only one thing more that I wanted
to mention, and I have left it to the last
because it is perhaps the most important thing
of all&mdash;it is on the subject of wills. It is not
generally known that every will is revoked by
marriage.</p>

<p>You cannot make a will, my dear Dorothy,
because you are not yet twenty-one years of
age; but Gerald can, and I consider that it is
his duty, and the duty of every man who gets
married, to make his will, no matter however
small the amount of the property he has to
dispose of may be.</p>

<p>There is no great difficulty about making
an ordinary will. All that is necessary is that
the intentions of the maker should be clearly
expressed, that he should sign it in the
presence of two witnesses, who should also
affix their signature, and that is all.</p>

<p>There is only one other thing to remember,
and that is that the witnesses should not be
people who benefit by the will, or rather, I
should say, who are intended to benefit by it,
for the result of such witnesses being left a
legacy would be that, although the rest of the
will would hold good, they would not get
their legacies. Also it is important for anyone
making a will to give the name of one
willing to act as executor.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that, when any difficulty
arises in the making of a will, it is advisable
to consult a solicitor or a barrister such as</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> we had very exhaustively explored this
middle part of the State, we determined to go
to San Francisco and see how we liked the
conditions in the North.</p>

<p>We took rooms in a fairly comfortable
boarding-house, and settled down for an
indefinite time. Our boys went to the public
schools, which, in the towns, are very good
indeed.</p>

<p>We found a great charm and attraction
about San Francisco, with its splendid bay
and curious town; the latter, built partly on a
tract of land snatched from the sea, and partly
on the drifting shifting sand hills, which
stretch for miles around, is a triumph of
energy and enterprise. Some of the streets
had to be carried up at an angle of almost
forty-five degrees, and the quays, water front
and business quarter are built on what was at
one time a shallow part of the bay. Now
innumerable electric and cable cars fly up and
down the steep hill streets. It is a strange
sensation to "go the round trip" on any of
these beautifully built machines; a sensation
not altogether comfortable at first. One
seems to be either slipping down the polished
seats, on to the top of the next person, from
the steep upward incline of the car, or one is
trying to look quite easy-minded as the thing
glides smoothly up to the edge of a cliff, and,
without pause, runs straight down the face of
it. Accidents, however, seem very rare, and
all is so well managed, that one soon forgets
to be uneasy, and some of these rides are
delightful. One in particular&mdash;to the Cliff
House&mdash;where the railroad is cut out of the
cliff half way up its steep side, with the beautiful
Pacific Ocean spread out below, and the
Golden Gate in full view, is magnificent.
China Town was thrillingly interesting to us,
and we behaved like veritable <i>gamins</i>, hanging
and dawdling about, flattening our noses
against windows, and trying to see all we
could of the ways of these mysterious people.
Our impressions were, and still remain, that
they are marvellously quick and clever, but
unlovely.</p>

<p>Now began again the same diligent search
that had kept us so busy in the South; far
and near, to different neighbourhoods on all
sides we went, seeing a great deal, and
receiving much kindness from strangers,
anxious to aid us to find what we wanted.
Indeed, all over the United States we were
impressed with the goodwill everyone showed,
taking trouble and thought to help us if possible,
and ready to be most hospitable, though
we were absolute strangers.</p>

<p>This was often very comforting during those
long months of undecided wanderings, when
we felt so particularly homeless, and so
anxious about the future, and the great
importance of choosing wisely.</p>

<p>We were often amused to find what very
unexpected people had ranches, somewhere
in the Golden State. The black porter on
the train; the man who swept out and
attended to the church opposite our boarding-house;
the driver of the hotel omnibus; our
Chinese laundryman, and the Irish woman
who succeeded him. This last-named proprietor
was very anxious to warn us against
unwise speculations. She considered speculation
the only business worth going into,
and herself made quite a good deal in this
way. Then there was the learnèd head of
a university, and the pretty young lady teacher
at one of the Normal schools; also the rich
Easterner, coming over three thousand miles
in his private car to escape the cruel winter
of the East. All these had ranches of different
kinds, and all were ready to help and
advise.</p>

<p>The only people whom we were very shy of
consulting were the "real estate" men. It is
true we had many a useful drive with them
to inspect new neighbourhoods, but we would
never have dreamt of buying on their recommendation.
We had heard too much from
others of the tricks they play, and the schemes
they carry through, to influence possible
buyers, and we took a rather wicked delight
in making them useful, while remaining perfectly
independent of them. We discovered
that everyone who had a ranch spoke as
though that part of the State were the only
possible neighbourhood where ranching was
sure to pay; yet we could not but notice
that each one was most ready to sell his
ranch.</p>

<p>It is said that every ranch in California is
for sale, if the proper price be offered. But
an explanation of this is that there seems to
be a kind of restlessness and a speculative
spirit in all Americans, which leads them to
undertake everything in a tentative spirit, and
makes them always ready to change, if any
profit or advantage can be assured. Most of
the ranches have that air, very plain at least
to English eyes; there is nearly always the
appearance of the owner being ready to move
on to something else.</p>

<p>Such changes are regarded in America as
perfectly natural occurrences. A man who
changes his business often, from whatever
cause, in England is looked upon as unsteady
and unreliable, almost good for nothing in
fact; but here the habit is so universal that
it calls forth no comment.</p>

<p>Considering how very difficult it is for an
ordinary young man entering upon life to hit
upon just the best thing for his abilities and
tastes, it seems a sensible view to take that
the door should be left open for change,
without any slur being cast on the stability or
steadiness of the worker.</p>

<p>The changes made by men over here are
most unexpected and often quite startling.
The man who did all the hauling of our heavy
furniture out to the ranch from the water
front in San Miguel, some seventeen miles by
road, was once a lawyer in the East. The
indoor life did not suit him, and he never
really liked his profession, so he came out
here and has drifted into this, becoming one
of the most skilled teamsters in all the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On a neighbouring large ranch, where a
good deal of labour is employed, and which
the proprietor only visits occasionally for a few
odd days, the manager and overseer is, or
rather was, a doctor, and a very good manager
he makes.</p>

<p>An elderly rancher we came across had
been a soldier during the Civil War; a farmer
in the East; had driven an express waggon,
and after ranching a short time in the South
and finding it difficult to make both ends
meet, emigrated to Oregon and became a
member of the State Legislature, in which
position the salary was probably not the only
pecuniary advantage.</p>

<p>We had not been long in the North when
we decided that the climate was not good
enough. We had left home and come six
thousand miles, and were critical. It was
damp and windy. In the fruit valleys, the
summers were quite as hot, if not more so,
than in the middle South. Most of the early
fruit comes from this part, and in the winter
there was rain, more or less constantly, for
four months.</p>

<p>In consequence of the heavier rainfall, the
North is much greener than the South; the
hills too are beautifully wooded with every
variety of tree. But in many neighbourhoods
the work of ranching is more fatiguing than in
the South; the soil is heavier, and the longer
wet season has many disadvantages for people
who do their own ranching.</p>

<p>By this time the uncertainty and general
homeless feeling of our lives was beginning to
be almost unendurable.</p>

<p>There were so many things to consider;
firstly, which kind of fruit paid the best and was
the least subject to accidents and the disappointments
of bad seasons; secondly, the quality
of land best suited to such fruit and the conveniences
for getting it to market; thirdly, the
amount of water to be had; this last quite as
vital as any point whatsoever about the land.
In fact one might almost be said to buy water
with land attached, so great is the value of a
certainty of enough water.</p>

<p>We were so much impressed with this,
that we were quite determined to buy land
only where there was a well-tried and well-established
irrigating system, and where all
the water difficulties of the neighbourhood
were solved and settled.</p>

<p>This resolve, with some others, had
eventually to go by the board; but of this
much we made sure when we bought, that
there was water enough running in a satisfactory
flume some two miles from our land.
The part which had to be taken more or less
on trust was the piping of the water to our
little settlement, and the dividing of it in a
fair and workable manner; this has given us
more trouble than we would care to undertake
again. The climate, too, had to be carefully
examined, even in California. And the view
meant a great deal to us; we were very
unwilling to settle in a plain or valley, where
soon our own windbreak trees would be the
only outlook, year in, year out.</p>

<p>A school within reach for the younger boy
was another point about which I was resolved
to be stubborn.</p>

<p>Then, though we had so unhesitatingly
chosen the absolute freedom of country life, in
preference to pretentious villadom, we did not
want isolation.</p>

<p>I was haunted with the remembrance of
those terribly lonely farms which one passes
as the train rushes through Kansas and
Missouri, where each desolate building stands
absolutely surrounded by miles and miles of
dreary-looking prairie waste.</p>

<p>We realised before long that if we could
find a place fulfilling some of the most
essential qualities for which we were striving,
we should have to let the rest go. Indeed,
in our diligent search, which brought
us into contact with so many ranchers of
several nationalities, we heard and saw so
much that was discouraging, that we determined
not to take any definite or binding
steps for some time, but go south, see how
we liked the climate and other conditions of
San Miguel, and then make our decision.</p>

<p>There is something of the same spirit of
jealousy between San Francisco and San
Miguel as there is (or used to be) between
Manchester and Liverpool; we could therefore
hear very little but the proverbial faint
praise of San Miguel while in the North. All
the same, we were resolved to try to find a
better climate, after travelling six thousand
miles in search of it.</p>

<h2><a name="FATHER_ANTHONY" id="FATHER_ANTHONY">FATHER ANTHONY.</a></h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a glorious summer morning in the year
of grace 1635, when a boy, aged some ten
years, and a pretty fair-haired maiden five
years his junior, were lolling in the shade
of a gigantic copper-beech, which towered in
front of the old manor house known by the
name of Combe Abbey. Hugh Travers, the
heir and only child of Sir Ralph Travers, was
a sturdy, well-grown lad, who bade fair to
follow in his father's footsteps as a soldier and
a courtier, for even now his manner towards
his little cousin, Cecily Wharton, was marked
by gentleness and good breeding, and he was
ever her protector and guardian in any childish
scrapes or difficulties in which they might
involve themselves.</p>

<p>Cecily was the orphan daughter of Lady
Travers's only sister. The child had lost both
her parents soon after her birth by the small-pox,
and her aunt had brought her to Combe
that she might be trained and educated under
her own eyes, and fitted for the position which
would be hers when she came of age, for she
was no penniless waif, and also that she might
be a companion for her own son Hugh. Lady
Wharton, though a devoted mother, tempered
her devotion with common-sense, and she well
knew the temptation to selfishness and egotism
which must assail a lad in her Hugh's position
were he brought up without companions of his
own standing, and amid the society of his
elders only. Her plan had so far been marked
by success. Hugh's gentle nature had been
brought more to the fore by the companionship
of the little girl, and her society had taught
him that there was the pleasure of others to be
thought of as well as his own.</p>

<p>On the morning in question the two young
people had been for a long ramble in the park
with their dogs, and had returned in time for
the midday meal, the summons to which they
were awaiting under the beech-tree. As they
thus rested, their gaze and their conversation
had turned on the old pile of buildings facing
them.</p>

<p>"Then Uncle Ralph did not build it,"
Cecily was saying, in connection with some
remark of Hugh's on the weather-beaten
appearance of the mansion.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ralph! Indeed, no! Why,
Cecily, it was old, very old, before my father
was thought of, or, for the matter of that, his
father, and grandfather before him."</p>

<p>"Then it must be old! And didn't his
father live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and his grandfather, too."</p>

<p>"Oh!"&mdash;in a puzzled tone from the child,
as if her ideas were not equal to going back
so far; and then, in a brighter key, consequent
on feeling on safer ground, "Then who did
build it?"</p>

<p>"The monks."</p>

<p>"What monks?"</p>

<p>"The monks who afterwards lived in it. It
was an abbey till Harry the Eighth, of gracious
memory, turned them out and gave it to one
of my forefathers."</p>

<p>"What did he do that for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know not for certain. Some say
one thing, and some another, but he gave it to
one of our forebears, and for that I bless his
memory."</p>

<p>"But he was cruel, and killed his wives."</p>

<p>"Some of them; yet I doubt not they
deserved it." And then, pointing to two
niches or small alcoves high up in the outer
wall, and only some ten feet or so below the
parapet, "See, Cecily&mdash;there is one of the
builders of the abbey, Abbot Swincow."</p>

<p>"That figure in the cowl?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and 'tis said he keeps guard over the
place to this day, though he has been dead
these hundreds of years."</p>

<p>"And is it true?" asked the little girl,
turning a look of semi-wonderment and awe
on her companion.</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not, save that no harm has
befallen the place, or us who live in it, since I
can remember."</p>

<p>"Then it <i>is</i> true, I make no doubt," said
the easily convinced child. "But who stands
in the other little hole?"</p>

<p>"No one now. I have heard father say
that there was a figure of a Father Anthony
once, but that stem of ivy you see crept up,
and, getting into the joints of the stone at the
base, loosened them, and in a storm one night
it was blown down and broken to pieces."</p>

<p>"And did they never stick the poor man
together again?"</p>

<p>"Never. His head now rests beside the
fountain basin in the lower garden, and bits of
his body and legs are in a heap against yon
wall."</p>

<p>"Poor man, poor man! and the ivy is taking
his place: one spray is growing right across
the opening where he stood."</p>

<p>"I've oft thought I should like to climb up
and get in the niche and see what the garden
and park look like from there, but the ivy is
not strong enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Hugh&mdash;you must not! You'd
be killed; and then what should I do?" And
in her eagerness Cecily clasped her cousin's
arm.</p>

<p>"Nay, I don't think I shall," replied Hugh,
laughing. "I have no hankering for a broken
neck; and, besides, you could not come with
me, and it would be no sport alone."</p>

<p>"No, don't go. It must be much nicer
down here than being like that poor broken
man was up there."</p>

<p>"Well, Cecily, I don't feel much like an
image just now, for there's the horn for dinner,
and I'm hungry. Let us go." And scrambling
to their feet the two happy children raced
across the grass to the house, and left Abbot
Swincow and the empty niche bathed in the
midday sunshine.</p>

<p class='ph3'><span class="smcap">By JESSIE MANSERGH</span> (Mrs. G. de Horne Vaizey), Author of "A Girl in Springtime," "Sisters Three," etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the explanations that followed, no
one showed a livelier interest than
Peggy herself. She was in her element
answering the questions which were
showered upon her, and took an artistic
pleasure in the success of her plot.</p>

<p>"You see," she explained, "I knew
you would all be talking about me, and
wondering what I was like, just as I was
thinking about you. As I was Arthur's
sister, I knew you would be sure to
imagine me a mischievous tom-boy, so I
came to the conclusion that the best way
to shock you would be to be quite too
awfully proper and well-behaved. I
never enjoyed anything so much in my
life as that first tea-time, when you all
looked dumb with astonishment. I had
made up my mind to go on for a week,
but mother is coming to-morrow, and I
couldn't keep it up before her, so I was
obliged to explode to-night. Besides,
I'm really quite fatigued with being
good&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And are you&mdash;are you&mdash;really not
proper after all?" gasped Mellicent,
blankly; whereat Peggy clasped her
hands in emphatic protest.</p>

<p>"Proper! Oh, my dear, I am the
most awful person. I am always getting
into trouble. You know what Arthur
was? Well, I tell you truly, he is
nothing to me. It's an extraordinary
thing. I have excellent intentions, but
I seem bound to get into scrapes.
There was a teacher at Brighton, Miss
Baker, a dear old thing. I called her
'Buns.' She vowed and declared that
I shortened her life by bringing on
palpitation of the heart. I set the
dressing-table on fire by spilling matches
and crunching them beneath my heels.
It was not a proper dressing-table, you
know&mdash;just a wooden thing frilled round
with muslin. We had two blazes in the
last term. And a dreadful thing occurred!
Would you believe that I was
actually careless enough to plump down
on the top of her best Sunday hat, and
squash it as flat as a pancake."</p>

<p>Despite her protestations of remorse,
Peggy's voice had an exultant ring as
she detailed the history of her escapades,
and Esther shrewdly suspected that she
was by no means so penitent as she declared.
She put on her most severe
expression, and said sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must be dreadfully careless. It
is to be hoped you will be more careful
here, for your room is far away from ours,
and you might be burned to death before
anyone discovered you. Mother never
allows anyone to read in bed in this
house, and she is most particular about
matches. You wouldn't like to be
burned to a cinder all by yourself some
fine night, I should say."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't&mdash;or on a wet one
either. It would be so lonely," said
Peggy calmly. "No; I am a reformed
character about matches. I support
home industries, and go in for safeties,
which 'strike only on the box.' But the
boys would rescue me." She turned
with a smile, and beamed upon the three
tall lads. "Wouldn't you, boys? If
you hear me squealing any night, don't
stop to think. Just catch up your ewers
of water, and rush to my bedroom. We
might get up an amateur fire-brigade to
be in readiness. You three would be
the brigade, and I would be the captain
and train you. It would be capital fun.
At any moment I could give the signal,
and then, whatever you were doing&mdash;playing,
working, eating, on cold, frosty
nights, just when you were going to bed,
off you would have to rush, and get out
your fire-buckets. Sometimes you might
have to break the ice, but there's nothing
like being prepared. We might have
the first rehearsal to-night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's rather funny to hear your talking
of being captain over the boys,
because the day we heard that you were
coming, they all said that if they were to
be bothered with a third girl in the
house, you would have to make yourself
useful, and that you should be their
fag. Max said so, and so did Oswald,
and then Robert said they shouldn't
have you. He had lots of little odd
things he wanted done for him, and that
he could make you very useful. He
said the other boys shouldn't have you;
you were his property."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Peggy pleasantly.
She looked at the three scowling, embarrassed
faces, and the bright, mocking
light danced back into her eyes. "So
they were all anxious to have me, were
they? How nice! I'm very pleased to
hear it. Is there any little thing I can
do for your honourable self now, Mr.
Darcy, before I dress for dinner?"</p>

<p>Robert looked across the room at
Mellicent with an expression which
made that young person tremble in her
shoes.</p>

<p>"All right, young lady, I'll remember
you," he said quietly. "I've warned
you before about repeating conversations.
Now you'll see what happens.
I'll cure you of that little habit, my
dear, as sure as my name is Robert
Darcy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Honourable Robert Darcy,"
murmured a soft and silvery voice from
the other side of the fireplace. Robert
turned his head sharply, but Peggy was
gazing into the coals with an air of
lamb-like innocence, and he subsided
into himself with a grunt of displeasure.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Saville came to
lunch, and spent the afternoon at the
vicarage. As Maxwell had said, she
was a beautiful woman, tall, fair, and
elegant, and looking a very fashionable
lady when contrasted with Mrs. Asplin
in her plain, well-worn serge, but her
face was sad and anxious in expression.
Esther noticed that her eyes filled with
tears more than once as she looked
round the table at the husband and wife
and the three tall, well-grown children,
and when the two ladies were alone in
the drawing-room she broke into helpless
sobbings.</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy you are! How I
envy you! Husband, children, all beside
you. Oh, never, never let one of your
girls marry a man who lives abroad.
My heart is torn in two; I have no rest.
I am always longing for the one who is
not there. I must go back&mdash;the Major
needs me; but my Peggy, my own little
girl! It is like death to leave her
behind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Asplin put her arms round the
tall figure, and rocked her gently to and
fro.</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" she said brokenly.
"I <i>ache</i> for you, dear; but I
understand! I have parted with a child
of my own&mdash;not for a few years, but for
ever, till we meet again in God's
heaven. I'll help you every way I can.
I'll watch her night and day; I'll coddle
her when she's ill; I'll try to make her
a good woman. I'll <i>love</i> her, dear, and
she shall be my own special charge. I'll
be a second mother to her."</p>

<p>"You dear, good woman! God bless
your kind heart!" said Mrs. Saville
brokenly. "I can't help breaking down,
but, indeed, I have much to be thankful
for. I can't tell you what a relief it is to
feel that she is in this house. The
principals of that school at Brighton
were all that is good and excellent, but
they did not understand my Peggy."
The tears were still in her eyes, but she
broke into a flickering smile at the last
word. "My children have such spirits!
I am afraid they really do give more
trouble than other boys and girls, but
they are not really naughty. They are
truthful and generous, and so wonderfully
warm-hearted. I never needed to
punish Peg when she was a little girl; it
was enough to show that she had
grieved me. She never did the same
thing again after that; but&mdash;oh, dear
me!&mdash;the ingenuity of that child in finding
fresh fields for mischief! Dear Mrs.
Asplin, I am afraid she will try your
patience. You must be sure to keep a
list of all the breakages and accidents,
and charge them to our account. Peggy
is an expensive little person. You know
what Arthur was."</p>

<p>"Bless him&mdash;yes! I had hardly a
tumbler left in the house," said Mrs.
Asplin, with gusto. "But I don't break
my heart about a few breakages. I
have had too much to do with schoolboys
for that. And now give me all the
directions you can about this precious
little maid while we have the room to
ourselves."</p>

<p>For the next hour the two ladies sat in
conclave about Miss Peggy's mental,
moral, and physical welfare. Mrs.
Asplin had a book in her hand in which
from time to time she jotted down notes
of a curious and inconsequent character.
"Pay attention to private reading. Gas-fire
in her bedroom for chilly weather.
See dentist in Christmas holidays.
Query: gold plate over eye-tooth?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
Boots to order, Beavan &amp; Co., Oxford
Street. Cod-liver oil in winter. Careless
about changing shoes. Damp brings on
throat. Aconite and bella-donna." So
on, and so on. There seemed no end to
the warnings and instructions of this
anxious mother, but when all was settled
as far as possible, the ladies adjourned
into the schoolroom to join the young
people at their tea, so that Mrs. Saville
might be able to picture her daughter's
surroundings when separated from her
by those weary thousands of miles.</p>

<p>"What a bright, cheery room," she
said smilingly, as she took her seat at
the table, and her eyes wandered round
as if striving to print the scene in her
memory. How many times, as she lay
panting beneath the swing of the punkah
she would recall that cool English room,
with its vista of garden through the
windows, the long table in the centre,
the little figure with the pale face and
long plaited hair, seated midway between
the top and bottom. Oh! the moments
of longing&mdash;of wild, unbearable longing,
when she would feel that she must
break loose from her prison-house and
fly away, that not the length of the earth
itself could keep her back, that she
would be willing to give up life itself
just to hold Peggy in her arms for five
minutes, to kiss the dear sweet lips, to
meet the glance of the loving eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But this would never do! Had she
not vowed to be bright and cheerful?
The young folks were looking at her
with troubled glances. She roused herself
and said briskly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see you make this a playroom as
well as a study. Somebody has been
wood-carving over there, and you have
one of those dwarf billiard-tables. I
want to give a present to this room&mdash;something
that will be a pleasure and
occupation to you all; but I can't make
up my mind what would be best. Can
you give me a few suggestions? Is
there anything that you need, or that you
have fancied you might like?"</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you," said Esther,
warmly; and echoes of "Very kind!"
came from every side of the table, while
boys and girls stared at each other in
puzzled consideration. Maxwell longed
to suggest a joiner's bench, but refrained
out of consideration for the girls' feelings.
Mellicent's eager face, however, was too
eloquent to escape attention.</p>

<p>Mrs. Saville smiled at her in an encouraging
manner.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, what is it? Don't be
afraid. I mean something really nice
and handsome; not just a little thing.
Tell me what you thought?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a new violin!" cried Mellicent
eagerly. "Mine is so old and squeaky,
and my teacher said I needed a new one
badly. A new violin would be nicest
of all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Saville looked round the table,
caught an expressive grimace going the
round of three boyish faces, and raised
her eyebrows inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes? Whatever you like best, of
course. It is all the same to me. But
would the violin be a pleasure to all!
What about the boys?"</p>

<p>"They would hear me play! The
pieces would sound nicer. They would
like to hear them."</p>

<p>"Ahem!" coughed Maxwell loudly;
and at that there was a universal shriek
of merriment. Peggy's clear "Ho!
ho!" rang out above the rest, and her
mother looked at her with sparkling eyes.
Yes, yes, yes; the child was happy!
She had settled down already into the
cheery, wholesome home-life of the vicarage,
and was in her element among these
merry boys and girls! She hugged the
thought to her heart, finding in it her
truest comfort. The laughter lasted
several minutes, and broke out intermittently
from time to time as that
eloquent cough recurred to memory, but
after all it was Mellicent who was the
one to give the best suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well, then, a&mdash;a what-do-you-call-it!"
she cried. "A thing-um-me-bob!
One of those three-legged things for
taking photographs! The boys look so
silly sometimes, rolling about together
in the garden, and we have often and
often said, 'Don't you wish we could
take their photographs! They <i>would</i>
look frights!' We could have ever so
much fun with a what-do-you-call-it."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's something like!" "Good
business." "Oh, wouldn't it be sweet!"
came the quick exclamations, and Mrs.
Saville looked most pleased and excited
of all.</p>

<p>"A camera!" she cried. "What a
charming idea. Then you would be able
to take photographs of Peggy and the
whole household, and send them out for
me to see. How delightful! Why,
that's a happy thought, Mellicent. I
am so grateful to you for thinking of it,
dear. I'll buy a really good, large one,
and all the necessary materials, and
send them down at once. Do any of
you know how to set to work?"</p>

<p>"I do, Mrs. Saville," Oswald said.
"I had a small camera of my own, but
it got smashed some years ago. I can
show them how to begin, and we will
take lots of photographs of Peggy for you,
in groups and by herself. They mayn't
be very good at first, but you will be
interested to see her in different positions.
We will take her walking, and bicycling,
and sitting in the garden, and every way
we can think of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And whenever she has a new dress,
or hat, so that you may know what they
are like," added Mellicent anxiously.
"Are her hats going to be the same as
ours, or is she to choose them for
herself?"</p>

<p>"She may choose them for herself,
subject, of course, to your mother's refraining
influence. If she were to
develop a fondness for scarlet feathers,
for instance, I think Mrs. Asplin should
interfere; but Peggy has good taste. I
don't think she will go far wrong," said
her mother, looking at her fondly; and
the little white face quivered before it
broke into its sunny, answering smile.</p>

<p>Three times that evening, after Mrs.
Saville had left, did her companions
surprise the glitter of tears in Peggy's
eyes; but there was a dignified reserve
about her manner which forbade outspoken
sympathy. Even when she was
discovered to be quietly crying behind
her book, when Maxwell flipped it mischievously
out of her hands&mdash;even then
did Peggy preserve her wonderful self-possession.
The tears were trickling
down her cheeks, and her poor little nose
was red and swollen, but she looked up
at Maxwell without a quiver, and it was
he who stood gaping before her, aghast
and miserable.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! I'm fearfully sorry!"</p>

<p>"So am I," said Peggy severely. "It
was rude, and not at all funny. And it
injures the book. I have always been
taught to reverence books, and treat
them as dear and valued companions.
Pick it up, please. Thank you. Don't
do it again." She hitched herself round
in her chair and settled down once more
to her reading, while Maxwell slunk back
to his seat. When Peggy was offended
she invariably fell back upon Mariquita's
grandiose manner, and the sting of her
sharp little tongue left her victims dumb
and smarting.</p>

<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">What "George Eliot" was Like.</span></p>

<p>A graphic portrait in words of the famous
novelist "George Eliot" has been given by
Mrs. Katherine S. Macquoid. "George
Eliot," she says, "was very plain, much
plainer than any of the portraits make her
out to be. Her mouth was repulsive, and
seen in some lights the nose seemed to protrude
unnaturally over the mouth; it did not
in reality, but one sometimes received that
impression.</p>

<p>"Her eyes were of that greenish hue seen
in the hazel nut; you might say almost that
they were hazel eyes shot with green. They
were not at all prominent, but had such a
wonderful look in them as they gazed at you,
or rather scanned you in a curious, sidelong
manner, peculiar to her. The only person
whom I can think of with eyes like George
Eliot was Home the medium."</p>


<p class='center p2'><span class="smcap">Get out of it.</span></p>

<p>Nothing is so narrowing, contracting,

<p class='p2'><span class="smcap">The Great Creator.</span>&mdash;"I feel profoundly
convinced," says Lord Kelvin, "that
the argument of design has been greatly too
much lost sight of in recent biological speculations.
Overpoweringly strong proofs of intelligent
and benevolent design lie around us,
and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical
or scientific, turn us away from them for a
time, they come back upon us with irresistible
force, showing to us through nature the influence
of a free will, and teaching that all living
things depend on one everlasting Creator and
Ruler."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> the time
of Adelicia
of Louvaine
there seems
to have been
a period
wherein
little or no
special
needlework
was done by
great and
royal ladies,
though its practice was kept up in what were
called "The Schools." In these, young gentlewomen
were taught fine needlework and
embroidery to qualify them to beguile in a
becoming manner the many enforced hours of
leisure in their lives, brought about by the
lack of outdoor amusements for women.</p>

<p>Many a rich and sumptuous vestment was
made in these schools for the service of the
Church, and some of the beautiful work
done there found its way to the Palace of
Westminster.</p>

<p>But towards the end of the 13th century,
when Eleanor of Castille was queen of
Edward I., needlework came to the front
again with enthusiasm. She herself was a
wonderful needlewoman, and her example
made it the fashion in every class of life.</p>

<p>Before accompanying her husband on a
crusade to the Holy Land, she embroidered a
beautiful altar-cloth with her own hands, and
gave it to the church at Dunstable.</p>

<p>It is to this queen we owe the use of
needlework tapestry-hangings as furniture for
walls. Up to this time tapestry had been
used solely for the decoration of altars and
other parts of churches.</p>

<p>Tapestry hangings were worked originally
entirely with the needle, and they were found
to be worth all the trouble and time bestowed
upon them in the increase of comfort they
brought into the palaces and castles of the
great people of the land. At first they were
rude in design, but those introduced by Queen
Eleanor were in very superior workmanship.
To her they must have been very welcome,
for she felt the change from the sunny south
to the damp, bleak English climate greatly.</p>

<p>Tapestries never remained permanently
hanging on the walls of a special hall or
castle, but accompanied the great people,
when travelling from one residence to another,
under the care of the grooms of the Chamber,
whose special office it was to hang them.</p>

<p>The history of tapestry is full of romance,
but can only be touched upon here when
worked by special royal seamstresses.</p>

<p><i>Margaret of Anjou</i>, wife of Henry VI.,
was a very good needlewoman, although the
troublous times in which she lived prevented
her devoting much time to the art. It was
she, however, who formed the first band of
women needle-workers, known in history as
the <i>Sisterhood of the Silk Women</i>.</p>

<p>Needlewomen found a very valuable patron
in Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry of
Lancaster. She and her ladies spent much
time in needlework of all kinds.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How oft with needle, when denied the pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has she on canvas traced the blessed name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Henry, or expressed it with her loom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silken threads, or 'broidered it with gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>During the "Wars of the Roses" ladies
of high rank were often compelled to earn
their bread and that of their children by the
use of the needle. The Countess of Oxford
in the reign of Elizabeth of York was an
example of this. She was the first peeress
who is said to have earned her living by the
use of the needle. Edward IV. had deprived
her of her dower, and she and her little
children would have starved had she not been
a skilful needlewoman. She lived dependent
on the work of her hands for fifteen years, until
her husband's rank and fortune were restored.</p>

<p><i>Katherine of Arragon</i>, the first wife of
Henry VIII., was very skilful with her needle,
having learned the art from her mother,
Isabella of Spain, and it is more than likely
that in her early days she took part in the
trials of needlework established by Isabella
among Spanish ladies.</p>

<p>She was in the habit of employing the
ladies of her Court in needlework, working
with them and encouraging them.</p>

<p>Her work with the needle has been celebrated
both in Latin and English verse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"(Although a queene), yet she her days did pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In working with the <i>needle</i> curiously;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in the Tower, and places more beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her excellent memorials may be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby the <i>needle's</i> prayse is dignifide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her faire ladies, and herselfe, a queene."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter to Wolsey she writes, "I am
horribly busy, making standards, banners and
badges."</p>

<p>It is a matter of history that when Wolsey
and the Pope's Legate went to Bridewell to
visit Queen Katherine on the subject of her
divorce, they found her and her maids at work,
and she came to them with a skein of red
silk round her neck.</p>

<p>Katherine of Arragon's successor, <i>Anne
Boleyn</i>, could not help being a good needlewoman,
for she had been educated at the
Court of Francis I., under the superintendence
of Anne of Bretagne who made needlework
the business and the pleasure of her life.
It was her habit to collect the children of the
nobility within her Court daily and teach
them tapestry, embroidery and plain sewing
till they became accomplished seamstresses.</p>

<p>As wife of Henry VIII. Anne Boleyn and
the ladies of her Court spent much time in
making garments for the poor in plain
sewing as well as in embroidery and tapestry&mdash;much
of the last may still be seen in
Hampton Court. All this notwithstanding,
she did not love needlework and never resorted
to it for solace or amusement.</p>

<p><i>Katharine Howard</i>, another wife of
Henry VIII., was skilful in making pretty
kerchiefs and other dainty articles of the
toilette, some of which she once made out of
an old shirt of fine holland which had been
given her by her lover Derham. She is said,
in return for the shirt, to have worked for
him with her own hand a band and a pair of
finely embroidered shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>She and her maidens made a great many
shirts and smocks for the poor.</p>

<p><i>Katharine Parr</i>, the last wife of Henry
VIII., was almost as skilled a needlewoman
as his first. When young she objected
strongly to learning needlework; this was
probably because it had been foretold by an
astrologer that "she should sit in the highest
seat of imperial majesty." At all events
history reports her as saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"My hands are ordered to touch crowns
and sceptres, not needles and spindles."</p>

<p>She must have thought better of it, however,
for there are some beautiful specimens
of her work preserved in Westmoreland;
specially a counterpane and toilet cover.</p>

<p><i>Lady Jane Grey</i> is said to have been a
clever needlewoman, and that "instead of
skill in drawing she cultivated the art of
painting with the needle." There is still
preserved at Zurich a toilet cover beautifully
ornamented by her own hands and presented
by her to Bullinger.</p>

<p>About this time the dress of the nobles was
gorgeous and beautiful in the extreme; not
that the materials themselves were so costly,
but because of the exquisite work and embroidery
bestowed upon them by ladies of
high rank.</p>

<p>The beds also at this period owed their
rich beauty to women's work; they were not
at that time excluded from the day apartments
and were frequently among the richest ornaments
of the sitting-room, so much taste and
expense were bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The curtains of the bed were often of rich
material adorned with embroidery.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her bed-chamber was hanged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tapestry of silk and silver."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="citation">
<i>Shakespeare.</i>
</p>

<p>Royal seamstresses at this time worked
rich needlework borders and belts for their
dresses, but they put their richest work on the
pouches or purses suspended from the waist
of the dress.</p>

<p>Queen Mary, daughter of Henry VIII.
and Katherine of Arragon, must have had
fame as a needlewoman, otherwise John
Taylor the historian would not have written of
her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her greatness held it no dis-reputation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To take the <i>needle</i> in her Royal hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was a good example to our Nation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To banish idleness from out her Land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed she seems to have been skilled in all
sorts of embroidery, and beguiled the time
after her mother's divorce peaceably and
laudably with needlework. Some of her work
is in the Tower. She was clever in embroidering
the covers of books.</p>

<p>The book called St. Mary's Psalter contained
the history of the Old Testament in a
series of small paintings, with a very richly
worked cover which is supposed to have been
embroidered by Mary herself. The embroidery
as far as one can see was done on fine canvas
or coarse linen put on crimson velvet.</p>

<p>It never occurs to us to think of <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i> as a needlewoman, yet to a certain
extent she must have been one, for history
tells us of a cambric smock which she made
and presented to her brother Edward when he
was six years old. She seems to have excelled
however in embroidering the backs of books.
Needlework although not enthusiastically
practised in Elizabeth's reign was by no
means despised.</p>

<p>But of all royal seamstresses, Mary Queen
of Scots carries off the palm both for beauty,
quantity and variety.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She wrought so well in needlework, that she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet her workes shall ere forgotten be."&mdash;<i>John Taylor.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her teachers in the art were Lady Fleming&mdash;her
governess&mdash;and Catherine de Medicis
whose needlework was unrivalled. During
the time the young Queen of Scots was at the
French Court she and the French Princesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
assembled every afternoon in the private
apartments of Queen Catherine, where for
two or three hours all were occupied in
needlework.</p>

<p>At no time of her life were her hands idle;
she plied her needle even while listening to
the discussions of her ministers. Needlework
was to her a source of real pleasure.</p>

<p>While under the care of the Earl of Shrewsbury
at Tulbury Castle she, with the help of
Bess of Hardwick, her guardian's wife, worked
a pair of curtains, a counterpane, and a
vallance on green velvet.</p>

<p>In describing her daily life here, she said
that all the day she wrought with her needle,
and that the variety of the work made it seem
less tedious.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room at Hardwick there are
several pieces of her work well preserved, and
in Scotland there are parts of certain bed-hangings
in which M. S. is worked in very
frequently.</p>

<p>Her tapestry work proved a blessing to her,
as in the year 1586 she writes, "My residence
is a place enclosed with walls situated on an
eminence and consequently exposed to all the
winds and storms of heaven.... I have
for my own accommodation only wretched
little rooms, and so cold that were it not for
the protection of the curtains and tapestries
which I have put up, I could not endure it by
day and still less by night."</p>

<p>In the execution of all this work Mary
Queen of Scots beguiled many a weary hour
at Chatsworth, Buxton and Sheffield, while
brooding over the plots for her escape and the
intrigues and jealousies of Bess of Hardwick.</p>

<p>She made a vest for her only son but he
ungraciously refused it because she addressed
him as Prince and not as King of Scotland.
She worked also with her own hands an altar-piece,
and presented it to the church of the
convent where she had been educated. She
was the first, I believe, to do the raised work
in crewels.</p>

<p>We now come to a very remarkable needlewoman,
whose work is considered not only
equal to that of Matilda, wife of the Conqueror,
but superior to it, because it was all
done with her own hands. Her name was
Jean or Joan D'Albret, better known as the
mother of Henry IV. of Navarre.</p>

<p>Her needlework which was the amusement
and solace of her leisure hours was designed
by her to commemorate her love for the
Reformed faith which she publicly professed
on Christmas Day, 1562. She worked several
large pieces of tapestry, among which was a
suite of hangings consisting of a dozen or
fifteen pieces which were called "The Prisons
Opened," on which she represented that she
had broken the pope's bonds and shaken off
his yoke. She had a great sense of satire and
humour which showed itself in her work.</p>

<p>The Duc de Sully, when sent by King
Henry IV. to receive the Cardinal of Florence
at Paris in grand style, ordered the keeper of
the castle at St. German-en-Laze to hang the
walls and chambers with the finest tapestry
of the Crown. This he did, but, unfortunately,
for the Legate's own chamber he chose a suite
of hangings made by the Queen Joan D'Albret
herself. They were very rich, it is true, but
they represented nothing but emblems and
mottoes against the pope and the Roman
Court, as satirical as they were ingenious.
Fortunately the mistake was rectified by Sully
before the Cardinal's arrival.</p>

<p>This clever needlewoman died suddenly at
the Court of France in 1572.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span>
that the days are
shortening and
the weather dull,
those of us who
took holiday during
the summer
and early autumn
will once more
gather round the
fireside in the
twilight, and find
pleasure in looking
back upon
the happy time
we spent in lovely
inland places or
by the sea. Our
winter gatherings
are brightened by such retrospections,
and as we talk we seem to see again the
waves glittering in the sunlight, or to hear
their roar as they break angrily on the
beach, more beautiful in storm than in calm.
We tell of new experiences and impressions,
of minds enriched, and of bodily strength
renewed by change of scene and occupation,
or it may be by rest and quiet surroundings.</p>

<p>These words apply specially to those
amongst you, my dear girl friends and
fortunate holiday makers, who were able to
leave ordinary cares and anxieties behind
you, and enjoy to the full the new
beauties amid which you found yourselves.</p>

<p>To take holiday, without need for
care about ways and means, and possessing
a good share of health and
strength to begin with, would seem to
most of us the perfection of enjoyment.
Yet I am by no means sure that we
should judge rightly. Can you not well
imagine that the rare holiday, obtained
at the cost of long saving and even self-denial,
may have brought to some an
intensity of enjoyment unknown to
those who have only to will in order
to obtain any indulgence they desire.
If each could give her personal experience
this evening, what varied stories
should we hear. Some, who longed for
and much needed a holiday, would tell that
they had been kept at home and at work all
through the hot days by poverty or the sickness
of one they loved and could not bear to leave.</p>

<p>Others, who left home hoping for renewed
health, may have returned disappointed.
Some may have expected only enjoyment,
and have found pain and trouble as their
constant companions. To those amongst
you who have had all and even more than you
hoped for, let me say, "Look back upon
your happy experiences with heartfelt thankfulness
to the Giver of all good, and resolve
that, by the help of the Holy Spirit, you will
use your increased knowledge and strength
in His service and for your neighbour's good."</p>

<p>If any of you have spent money lavishly
upon yourselves, or upon those who did not
need your gifts, think, before another holiday
season comes round, of some of those who
are poor and longing for what you could so
easily give them. You, who can take holiday
and have change when you wish, might make
some of your poorer sisters very happy by
giving them a taste of what you can always
enjoy even to repletion. Try to diffuse
blessings by sparing something out of your
abundance, and your own enjoyment will be
doubled, as well as your sense of wealth, in
the very act of imparting. I am speaking in
time&mdash;am I not, dear girls? I think I hear
some of you say, "When the days are
lengthening again it will be time enough to
talk of the next summer holidays."</p>

<p>It may be so with those who can give out
of their abundance, but by far the greater
number of us could only render such help by
saving a little at a time the year round. In
all earnestness, but leaving the method to
yourselves, I ask such of you as are able to
give in the future to some poor toiler a taste
of the happiness you can now look back upon
from the home fireside. If, in any neighbourhood,
a few of you, my dear girl friends, will
combine for this purpose, all your own
pleasures will be increased, and your memories
enriched by so doing.</p>

<p>To those amongst you who have this year
been saddened by disappointment, I say,
"Look forward hopefully, asking the while
that the power to do this may be given you.
Try not to look back upon the dark days, or
to dwell mentally on what cannot be undone."</p>

<p>Several years ago, I was staying in a
charming home, from the different sides of
which we could look on scenery of very
opposite kinds. The house stood just beyond
what is called "The Black Country," and
looking into a valley in one direction, we
could see the glare of the smelting furnaces,
and the smoke rising from the coal-pit banks.
From these indications we knew that both
aboveground and below it in the mines work
never ceased.</p>

<p>If we looked from the other side, we saw a
lovely range of beautifully wooded hills in the
distance, and below them all the fair features
of an English landscape. If we had kept our
eyes fixed on the valley behind us, we should
have seen only blackness and comparative
desolation, whilst the sense of ceaseless toil
would have been ever present to us.</p>

<p>So, dear disappointed ones, I pray you turn
your backs on the inevitable, and, though
there may be no fair landscape within sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
you can always look heavenward with your
mind's eye, even whilst your hands are busy,
and, it may be, your spirit is heavy within
you.</p>

<p>Friends may be forgetful. No human
message of cheer or comfort may reach you,
or bit of much needed help be in sight, but
still there are messages which you can claim,
and consolations meant expressly for you,
which are better than the best which mortal
lips can utter, for they come from Him Who
cannot lie. You are invited to cast your care
upon God, for "He careth for you." This
one sweet assurance is like the fair landscape
on which we can turn the eye of faith, and
forget the gloomy realities which lie behind
us.</p>

<p>But God works by human instrumentality,
and it is for those whom He has helped with
the power to exercise the precious privilege of
brightening the lives of others. Let your
givings be in accordance not only with your
own means, but with the needs of those whom
you help.</p>

<p>I daresay you have often noticed the
number and costliness of the gifts bestowed
upon those who have already much of this
world's wealth. You have heard such words
as these when a friend's birthday or some
other festive occasion called for special remembrance:
"I could not give a poor
present. I felt that I must give something
really handsome, or I should have been ashamed
of my gift among so many beautiful things."</p>

<p>Oh! it is sad to think that our givings are
influenced so much more by the thought of
how they will impress our neighbours, and
how the gifts will look in comparison with
theirs.</p>

<p>There is a verse in the Book of Proverbs
which I have seldom heard quoted, but which
bears upon what I have said. "He that
oppresseth the poor to increase his riches,
and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely
come to want." In beautiful contrast are the
words also from the Book of Proverbs, "He
that giveth unto the poor shall not lack" and
"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth
unto the Lord; and that which he hath given
will He pay him again."</p>

<p>So, dear ones who have enough and to
spare, I ask you to make the Lord your
debtor&mdash;precious thought!&mdash;by devising plans
for the benefit of your poorer sisters, and
be sure of this&mdash;your paymaster will not
fail you. Your reward will not come to you
in gold and silver, but it will satisfy you here,
and you will reap an eternal harvest in return
for every hour of happiness purchased for
others by willing self-sacrifice on your part.
I trust that by your efforts many hearts will
be gladdened and bodies strengthened, through
what we have talked about to-night, in the
twilight side by side.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask you what precious
opportunities you had, and whether you used
or wasted them, during your summer holidays?
When we last met, I quoted an expression I
had heard from the pulpit, and which had
impressed me deeply. "We should be misers
in the use of time and opportunity." We
talked at some length on one of these precious
trusts, but little was said about the second.</p>

<p>I am sure you will feel with me that we
cannot be amidst new scenes and brought
into contact with fresh people, and fail to
have new opportunities of speaking kind
words, giving little messages of comfort, and
showing, though it may be only by trifling
actions, consideration for others. In order to
take advantage of such openings we must not
be self-absorbed. We must be on the look-out
for opportunities, or we may miss them.</p>

<p>It happens, not infrequently, that a holiday-time
is regarded as a season of pure self-indulgence.
We have worked hard for our
holiday, or we can afford to have whatever we
desire. So we decide to fill our daily cup of
enjoyment to the brim. We care little what
trouble we give by our untidy habits to the
tired workers who serve in the houses which
are our temporary homes. We leave orderly
ways and punctuality behind us, and rather
enjoy the idea of having escaped from home
rule in every shape, saying to ourselves, "It
is holiday-time. Surely we may follow our
own inclinations."</p>

<p>We laugh perhaps over nearly empty purses
when packing-up day comes, and are apt to
wonder where the money has gone. If we ask
ourselves the questions, "How much has been
devoted to others? What have I given
towards the expenses of the church I have
attended during my stay in this place?" I
fear a blush of shame would often come to the
owner of that purse whose contents have been
so carelessly scattered.</p>

<p>I have known, and I still know, dear
friends both young and old who, when going
for a holiday, put aside a weekly sum in
accordance with their means to be spent in
good doing as opportunities present themselves.
This is their thank-offering to God
for their own bright holiday. Those who
have pinched and saved and been obliged to
calculate every penny before leaving home,
and who, whilst absent, have "to turn a penny
both sides up before spending it," as I heard
a poor woman remark, cannot spare coin from
their purses. But opportunities come, nevertheless.
The possessor of a comfortable seat
on shore or promenade, or beneath a sheltering
tree, may give place to a wan-faced
mother, weary with carrying her baby, and
looking longingly but vainly for an empty
place whereon to rest.</p>

<p>Ailing people are often eager to speak of
the sad time of sickness they have passed
through, and it is no small comfort to them if
a stranger, resting on the same bench, will
listen patiently, sympathise with their weakness
and encourage their budding hopefulness
by cheering words. What opportunities these
incidental meetings give for saying something
about the Great Physician of souls; of God's
love in Christ; of our daily needs and dependence
upon God, and His willingness to supply
all our needs.</p>

<p>If the help of a girl's strong arm can aid
age and weakness in the journey from the
shore to the humble lodging, why should
any young servant of Christ wait to compare
her pretty summer dress with the faded black&mdash;the
badge of poverty and widowhood&mdash;worn
by the feeble, old body she would like to
help? Should we not try to think how God
regards even the smallest labour of love
undertaken for our weak neighbour, rather
than of what our fashionable friend will say if
she sees us in such lowly company?</p>

<p>It needs a very grateful and a very loving
nature to be constantly on the look-out, so as
to lose no opportunity of good doing. The
heart must be full of gratitude to God for
mercies bestowed, and of tender consideration
towards every human sister and brother, for
His dear sake.</p>

<p>Many years ago, I was honoured by the
friendship of a good man who possessed such
a nature as I have described. In whatever
place or company he might find himself&mdash;and
more especially if he had been unexpectedly
brought into it&mdash;his first thought would be, "I
am not here for nothing;" his first question,
"What work has God for me to do in this
place?"</p>

<p>Stranded on one occasion at a country
railway station through the lateness of a train
which caused him to miss another, he was for
the moment inclined to chafe at the delay.
Time was very precious to him that day, and
two hours of waiting would probably hinder
him from saying farewell to a son about to
start on a long voyage. But the habits of
submission to the inevitable, and of looking
around him for some opportunity of doing
his Master's will and serving his neighbour,
asserted themselves. A few minutes later, a
young man, a passenger delayed by the same
cause as he was, sat down beside him, and,
after remarking, "You and I are in the same
boat, I suppose, sir," began to find fault with
the bad railway arrangements, and to threaten
all sorts of things against the Company&mdash;actions
for damages, and so on.</p>

<p>My friend could hardly help smiling at his
neighbour's impetuosity, but he listened
patiently, and at length the young man cooled
down and laughed also.</p>

<p>"I daresay this seems foolish talk," he
added; "and it is a great deal easier to
threaten than to do, when it is a question
of taking the law against a big railway
Company; but this delay is a serious matter
to me, as you would say, if you knew all
about my business. You are a clergyman, I
see. I am the son of one. May I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man paused, and my friend,
thinking to himself, "I am not delayed for
nothing," finished the question, or rather
answered it by saying, "You may look on
me as your father's representative, if you
will, or as a friend to whom you may speak
freely."</p>

<p>I am not going to tell you what followed.
The story would be too long in detail, but I
may say this much. To the end of his days
my friend thanked God for that delay at the
railway station, and the young man had still
greater cause to do so. He was about to take
a rash step, which would have caused sorrow
to those who loved him and spoiled his own
career; but, won by the fatherly manner of
the old minister of God, he was induced to
confide in him, and the wise advice he received
set him thinking. Thought was followed by
repentance, and this by change of purpose.
Instead of continuing his journey, he took the
homeward train, and before my friend resumed
his, the two had parted with a warm hand-clasp
and a promise of letters to follow.</p>

<p>Years after, when the old pastor told the
story, he said, "I felt sure that I was not
stranded at that railway station for nothing,
but that there must be some chance of usefulness,
some work that my Master meant me
to do. The chapters of that young man's life
story that have been written since are very
different from what they might have been
but for that opportune delay which gave him
time to pause and think. Thank God! His
father never knew how near the lad was to
life wreckage, and to-day he is proud of the
son who is the staff and comfort of his age.</p>

<p>"Did I see my own son before he sailed?
you ask. No&mdash;I was too late, but the telegraph
took him my farewell and blessing, and
we have had many happy meetings and
hopeful partings since then."</p>

<p>My dear old friend's earthly labours have
long been ended; but, as I think of him, I
seem to see his face shining with glad thankfulness,
as he recalled this opportunity of
usefulness given him by God and so happily
utilised, though the delay in another sense
cost him a disappointment.</p>

<p>Had my friend spent the time in grumbling
at the delay, instead of thinking how it could
be turned to good account, how different
would have been the result! Or, if he had
kept sullenly aloof, or answered his young
neighbour's remark curtly, thus repelling his
half-offer of confidence, the current of a life
would have set in the wrong direction, and
the chances of doing and receiving good
would have been lost for ever.</p>

<p>Opportunity comes under so many forms,
means so much, and is so often lost.</p>

<p>We live, it may be, near places of beauty
and interest. Because we are near, we think
we can visit them at any time, but we never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
them at all. We have opportunities of obtaining
useful information, of gaining valuable
experiences and increasing our stores of knowledge.
We put off availing ourselves of them
until some unknown future time, which never
comes.</p>

<p>But the time does come to most of
us when we want just the knowledge or
experience that we might have had if we had
utilised past opportunities, and then, we
either gain it at much greater cost of time
and trouble, or we suffer for the want of it, to
say nothing of the additional pang of self-reproach
which comes with the need.</p>

<p>Money frittered away in vanity and folly
means the loss of chances for making others
happy and lifting the burdens from overweighted
shoulders. Lost opportunities for
giving pleasure to those we love are brought
home to us with a terrible sting afterwards.</p>

<p>Do we ever lose a relative or beloved friend
without feeling our sorrow intensified by the
thought of some little wish neglected, some
opportunity for giving pleasure lost?</p>

<p>It is generally the little ones that are missed,
when they concern those we dearly love.
Great opportunities are seldom ignored. But
when it is too late and we feel, oh, so sadly,
that we might have availed ourselves of the
lesser ones also, these, however trifling,
assume an importance not realised until, with
the sense of omission, comes the thought that
they are lost for ever.</p>

<p>I should feel guilty were I to close our talk
to-night without reminding you, dear girl
friends and companions, of the supreme
importance of some opportunities which you
may not have valued, because they are always
open to you; I mean the blessed privilege of
coming to God as your Father and unchanging
Friend; a Father whom you have often
disobeyed and neglected&mdash;even forgotten, but
who yet loves you with an everlasting love,
loves you so much that He did not spare His
own beloved Son, "but delivered Him up for
us all," that through His death eternal life
might be purchased and bestowed&mdash;a free gift
on you and me.</p>

<p>May our Father bestow His Holy Spirit upon
us all, so that, seeing our sinfulness and need,
we may go to His footstool pleading Christ's
sacrifice, and thus obtain pardon, joy and
peace in believing.</p>

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Waiting in Hope.</span>&mdash;Freckles are undoubtedly due to
the sun. They are not caused by <i>heat</i> but by <i>light</i>.
There is always a certain amount of pigment in
the skin, and under the influence of strong light
this pigment increases greatly in quantity, and
becomes gathered together in small patches. These
patches are freckles. Where the light of the sun
is more intense than it is in our climate, the patches
of pigment coalesce, and the face and other exposed
parts of the body become uniformly discoloured.
Constant exposure to the intense light of the
tropical sun, through many generations, has produced
the black or brown skin of the coloured
races. Since the light rays which cause freckles
cannot pass through substances coloured red, persons
inclined to freckles should always wear a red
veil, or carry a red parasol. Remaining in a
darkened room for an hour or so after exposure to
the sun will often prevent the face from becoming
freckled. The best preparations to apply to the
face for the removal of freckles are glycerine and
rose-water, glycerine and lime-water, and toilet
vinegar. Peroxide of hydrogen bleaches the pigments
of the skin, but it is rarely necessary to
resort to it for the removal of freckles, unless all
other methods fail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious Enquirer.</span>&mdash;This is something new to us!
That photographic films should be "splendid to
put on the nose to remove red spots, or any redness,"
we have certainly never before heard, nor
could we have guessed this curious and unexpected
development of photography. Films consist of
albumen, gelatine, or collodion, impregnated with
an emulsion of an insoluble salt of silver, and how
any of these could influence face "decorations"
due to indigestion we cannot tell. Perhaps the
silver might turn the spots black, but what other
benefits the films could produce we cannot conceive.</p>

<p>W. P. W.&mdash;Your case is easy to understand, if it is
true that you have heart disease. What do you
eat, and how do you eat it? Do you swallow down
a cup of tea and a bite of something for breakfast
before rushing off to catch your train? Do you
snatch a hasty lunch at any hour at which you are
at leisure? or do you forego lunch altogether, and
take nothing between breakfast and dinner? If
you are guilty of any of these acts of indiscretion,
you must expect to suffer. Your unpleasant
symptoms are probably in the main due to errors
of diet. You must be very careful about your
feeding; never take any indigestible food; never
eat in a hurry, and never, not if a whole year's
income depends upon it, must you run off directly
after a meal to catch a train. You should eat
slowly; little at a time and often, and take at least
four meals a day. You should take tea in great
moderation, and you should carefully guard against
constipation from any cause.</p>

<p>E. T.&mdash;What is the size of the spot on your chin? If
it is small, it is a "spider nævus," and can be
readily removed by touching its centre with a red-hot
needle. Of course this must be done by a
surgeon. No other form of treatment is of any
avail. If the spot is larger than a split pea, it can
hardly be removed in this way, but it will probably
be amenable to some other form of surgical procedure.
In any case we advise you to go to a
surgeon about it, and not to try to meddle with it
yourself, for you can do no good by external
application.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mizpah.</span>&mdash;We cannot advertise any special soap in
this column. All soap used for the skin should be
hard, opaque or semi-opaque, and either scented
or medicated with carbolic acid, tar, etc. Never
use any patent soap, and above all, never use
arsenical soap.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ajax.</span>&mdash;It is delightful and rare for us to be able to
offer musical commendation twice consecutively.
Your compositions are good enough for us to urge
you, in reply to your question, at once to take
harmony lessons. In spite of the merit of the
chants, there are blemishes in them&mdash;consecutive
fifths, etc.&mdash;which good teaching would enable you
to avoid. We particularly like the close of the
"Kyrie"; it is very musical. You should work
hard, and may hope to succeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tam o' Shanter.</span>&mdash;1. Much depends on individual
taste and preference in the selection of a subject to
study alone. If you are fond of languages, we
should advise you to take up Italian, and get
Dr. Lemmi's Italian Grammar. You might with
advantage join the National Home Reading Union.
Address the Secretary, Surrey House, Victoria
Embankment, London.&mdash;2. Your friend could certainly
study French alone; if she could get a little
help with the pronunciation, it would be better.
We should recommend her to procure Havet's
French Course.</p></div>


<h3>OUR OPEN LETTER BOX.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M. E. J. (Malvern) kindly sent us some information
about an extract we have repeatedly tried to trace.
In consequence of her suggestion, we wrote to
Messrs. Bemrose &amp; Sons, 23, Old Bailey, E.C., who
have forwarded us a small pink card headed "Resolve."
On one side are the words:</p>

<p class="noindent">"I expect to pass through this world but once;
any good thing therefore that I can do, or any
kindness that I can show to a human being, or any
word that I can speak for Jesus&mdash;let me do it <i>now</i>.
Let me not neglect or defer it, for I shall not pass
this way again."</p>

<p class="noindent">On the reverse side of the card we read:</p>

<p class="noindent">"This Resolve was written by a New York lady,
much impressed with the thought of the uncertainty
of life. Not many days after, she was at a meeting
in Madison Square Gardens, where she had distributed
some printed leaflets with the Resolve,
when the hall roof fell in and she was one of those
killed by its fall."</p>

<p class="noindent">The sentence has been frequently referred, by
our correspondents, to Marcus Aurelius. We give
the information just as we have received it. The
cards, we may add, are 5d. per dozen, post free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. H. Coupland</span> sends Lilian the verse inquired for
in "The Lesson of the Water Mill," by Sarah
Doudney. <span class="smcap">Laira, A. S., Acacia, A Schoolgirl</span>,
point out that the verse Lilian quotes is the fourth,
not the last. The last verse runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, the wasted hours of life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That have drifted by!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the good that might have been!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lost without a sigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved ones that we might have saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Maybe, by a word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts conceived, but never penned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perishing, unheard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the proverb to thine heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take, and hold it fast:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The mill cannot grind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the water that is past.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The whole poem may be obtained for 1s. a hundred,
from Andrew Stevenson, Stationer, Mound, Edinburgh;
also as a "Stirling Leaflet, No. 52," from
Peter Drummond, Stirling; also in the <i>Practical
Elocutionist</i>, published by Blackie &amp; Son. If Lilian
will send her name and address to Mrs. Pawlby,
7, Maida Vale Terrace, Mutley, Plymouth, she will
receive a copy.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious.</span>&mdash;With reference to pensions accruing to
the widows of officers, that of a captain is £50 per
annum, and £12 to each child yearly; but should
death have resulted from exposure, privation or
fatigue, incident to active duty in the field, fifty
per cent. more is allowed. If from wounds received
in action, and within twelve months after having
been invalided, his widow would receive twice the
ordinary pension. But there are certain conditions
to be considered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel.</span>&mdash;As much may be said in favour of one place
you name as another. In the Isle of Wight,
Ventnor is much esteemed. In the south of
England, Bournemouth, Torquay, and Penzance.
In the Channel Islands, the south aspects and shore
of Guernsey and Jersey; and the Island of Sark
for asthma. We know of no "papers nor magazines"
that give the local information you require.
But there are little guides, as well as local papers,
respecting each place, in which you could find
addresses and advertisements as to situations for
persons needing employment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin-basket.</span>&mdash;1. The Mosaic-work made of broken
china is called "crazy-china," of which two illustrations
were given in vol. xvi., page 636. The
weekly number (doubtless to be had at our office)
was for July 6th, 1895.&mdash;2. The German-speaking
men of Europe wear wedding-rings. We have not
observed whether in other countries the practice
obtains as a rule of national observance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petruchio's Kate.</span>&mdash;We could not answer you in a
few sentences, so must recommend you to procure
a book on such games, viz., Brand's <i>Observations
on Popular Antiquities</i> (Chatto &amp; Windus), see
pages 205-215.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown Bee.</span>&mdash;If you failed to get that description
of chocolate at the Junior Army &amp; Navy Stores,
and at so many shops, we recommend her to visit
some of the large confectioners and grocers' stores
in the City.</p>

<p>M. S. C.&mdash;We do not know to which you refer, but a
"thunder-bolt" is a shaft of lightning, or stream
of electricity passing from the thunder-cloud to the
earth. In geology it means a belemnite or meteoric
stone, or fire-ball, which sometimes falls to the
earth; an aërolite, at times found of enormous
size; <i>aer</i> signifies "air," and <i>athos</i> a stone. It is
a combination of metal and stone. Fire-balls,
(<i>bolides</i>) and meteors are explosive, the meteors
appearing during the day, and the fire-balls at
night. Iron is specially present, but the metals
appear to be an alloy.</p>

<p>M. A. D.&mdash;We do not think you read our answers, or
you would not ask a question already so often
answered. There is no rule for the wearing of a
ring on any special finger, excepting only the
wedding-ring. But the third finger of the left
hand is not kept exclusively for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mildred.</span>&mdash;Your writing is too large and coarse-looking.
Slope it a little from left to right, and
reverse the plan in reference to the light and heavy
strokes, the downwards heavy, the upwards light.
It will be more graceful and artistic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;I have begun making a collection
of photos of bridges, and am very anxious to
get some from everywhere (except Australia),
especially Norway and Russia. Would some of
your girls kindly lend a hand? and in return, I
could send, not bridges, as I live in the bush, but
hornets, beetles, or stamps. The bridges must be
<i>named</i>, <i>unmounted</i>, and <i>not more than 8×6 inches</i>,
as I put them in a book.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> glance round the
markets and shops
in any week of December
tells us that
Christmas is the
prominent thought
in the minds of all
who have anything
to sell, and that
royal bird, the
turkey, is very much
<i>en evidence</i>. But we cannot eat turkey all
the weeks of December, and every day is not
Christmas Day. Let us, therefore, take a look
round with the object of seeing what else there
is that is peculiar to the month, and that will
help us in compiling our daily menus, as well
as to make variety on extra occasions.</p>

<p>Among fish we have the dory&mdash;supposed by
some to be the fish blessed by our Lord in the
miraculous feeding of the five thousand. It is
an unsightly fish, but most excellent for flavour
and delicacy, very much resembling turbot,
and it should be boiled and served the same
as the latter.</p>

<p>Turbot is also in excellent condition now,
so is cod; then we have ling, a cheap and
nourishing fish, thought much of by dwellers
on the northern coasts, and we have smaller
fish in abundance.</p>

<p>All meat is, of course, in prime condition&mdash;almost
too prime for some tastes&mdash;and we
may even indulge in an occasional little roast
pork, for if ever pork may be said to be
wholesome it is now. Hams and pickled
tongues make a feature in the shops now, also
pork pies of every imaginable size, weight and
kind. The wise and happy are they who can
cure their own hams, pickle their own tongues,
make their own sausages and bake their own
pies&mdash;these have not to be taken on trust.</p>

<p>The list of vegetables and fruits is a long
one; what we have not in a fresh state we
can purchase dried, and there is no lack of
variety either way.</p>

<p>Brocoli, savoys, celery, seakale and Scotch
kale are all at their best; a touch of frost
improves their flavour, but the later severe
frosts of January are apt to kill them off
entirely. We should make plentiful use of
these now, for there will come a time later
on when green food will be scarce, and we
can then bring out our dishes of carrots,
parsnips and the like.</p>

<p>As long as the supply of English apples and
pears lasts we should have them frequently,
we can have recourse to the cheaper foreign
kinds when our own are all gone. Almonds,
walnuts, filberts, hazel nuts, and many more,
are very plentiful, and this shows us they are
the natural food of winter time.</p>

<p>It might be well this month to devote one
of our menus to such dishes as are Christmas-like
in character, and to make the other
festive without being suggestive of this special
feast at all.</p>

<li>Cheese or Anchovy Croustades.</li>
</ul>

<p>A recipe for <i>Clear Gravy Soup</i> may not be
unnecessary. A pound of gravy beef, and a
small knuckle-bone of veal; simmer these in a
glazed earthenware vessel, that will hold about
two quarts of water, for several hours, but
never allow the liquor to boil. When about
half cooked add to it a whole carrot cut in
four, two or three onions and a bunch of
savoury herbs, but no turnip. Strain off the
liquor when done enough so that the fat may
settle on the top, and then carefully remove it
all. When about to re-heat it, pour it into a
fresh vessel and season it to taste, then add a
teaspoonful of cornflour wet with water, and
a teaspoonful of Liebig's Extract of Meat, to
give a little more "body" to the stock. Any
special flavouring liked may be added at this
time, but if the liquor has been properly
cooked its flavour will be sufficiently good.</p>

<p>When we speak of "boiled" fish of any
kind, it must be remembered that it should
never by any means actually "boil," but only
simmer gently until done. To boil anything
is to spoil it, although, as a cookery term, we
speak of it so.</p>

<p>Of the sauces, it may be needful to mention
one in detail, namely, the Genoise sauce.</p>

<p>For this take half a pint of milk and put it
into a saucepan with a few strips of thin rind
of fresh lemon; when it boils pour it on to a
spoonful of cornflour previously dissolved in
a little cold milk, add this to the yolks of two
eggs, an ounce of butter, pepper and salt, and
stir these carefully over the fire. When the
mixture boils, withdraw it, and add gradually
the juice of half a fresh lemon. This sauce
should be a clear bright yellow and of the
consistency of good cream.</p>

<p>It is usual to stuff a turkey with sausage-meat
at the breast end and put a veal stuffing
in the body of the bird, or a mixture of boiled
chestnuts, breadcrumbs and forcemeat is very
good, but somewhat rich. The time the bird
will take to roast depends entirely upon its
weight, a quarter of an hour to a pound is the
correct proportion to allow. Keep well basted,
and shield it from the fierce heat.</p>

<p>If intended for eating cold a turkey is never
so nice as when "braised," if only a vessel can
be found large enough to contain it and keep
it covered. A few slices of fat bacon should
be put with it, and plenty of good dripping,
and rather more time allowed than for roasting;
moreover, the cover should be kept
tightly closed to keep in the steam. Drain
away all the fat, but leave the bird to get cold
in the pan. Garnish with its gravy when that
has set to a jelly.</p>

<p>The sauce for a salmi should be prepared
first, and the joints of the birds just allowed
to simmer in it for a little while. Make the
gravy from very good strong stock, adding a
thickening that shall be transparent, and
whatever drops of gravy can be gathered
together. A little beef essence may be
needed to enrich the stock, also plenty of
seasoning. Chopped mushrooms should be
added whenever possible, not many will be
required. Serve fried potato chips with a
salmi, but no other vegetable.</p>

<p>Almost everyone has a recipe for plum
pudding; it is one of those possessions about
which every woman is more or less conceited,
so we will not take up space by giving another
here. <i>Neapolitan Pudding</i> may, however, be
new to some of our readers, and it is one that
is well worth being known by all. For it a few
macaroons, some sponge cakes, a little apricot
jam and a pint or more of rich well-flavoured
custard will be needed. Half an ounce of
dissolved isinglass should be stirred into the
custard, and this should be flavoured with
some essence. Arrange the macaroons at the
bottom and round the sides of a buttered
mould. Spread the sponge cakes with jam,
and fit them in, pouring a little juice over all.
Pour in the custard while it is hot, and cover
the mould tightly, setting it aside to become
cold and stiff. When it is turned out, heap
some bright jelly around the base and garnish
the top with preserved cherries and greengages
cut small.</p>

<p>Meringues are more difficult to make, and
require practice to do them well. The cases
require the frothed whites of the eggs to be
whisked until very firm, and the sugar should
be beaten in with a light hand. Drop this by
small spoonfuls on to greased note-paper;
bake to a very pale brown, slip off the paper
with a sharp knife, scoop out a little of the
inside and fill up with cream whipped very
stiffly. Any flavouring that may be liked can
be used.</p>

<p>Croustades of various kinds have been given
so often in these pages that it is hardly necessary
to repeat the recipe here. Fry the bread in
butter or lard, and spread with whatever
mixture is chosen whilst they are warm, garnish
prettily, and serve warm and fresh though
not hot.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
